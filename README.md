# Topology_solver
Calculates accurate result of Topology
Problem statement: write a program to count the number of preorders of a set of N elements for small N elements. For example, consider a set of 3 elements A={1, 2, 3}. From this set, we can make 29 suborders:

Or, the problem can be solved by counting the number of all possible topologies:

{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 1)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2)}
